# PlateScrape

PlateScrape was designed to make sure that you have evertyhing you need on your shopping list to make those online recipes you've been thinking about cooking up.

We take all the ingredients and measurements from an online recipe and create a shopping list of these items and amounts needed to create the recipes. The items in the user's shopping list is compared with the items the user already has at home in their own fridge to make sure that they don't buy anything they already have at home. Thus saving the user money and making sure they have everything they need to create their own pinterest masterpiece!
